How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me review my code and notice small differences I would have skipped over.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It allows me to make revisions more quickly by seeing the history and quickly reverting if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

They make your code more manageable and easier to maintain. You can view changes to your code and revert them if needed since your committs usually reflect a feature.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because there are dependacies

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

When running those commands you see the last altered files and lines of code

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

if you break something you can always revert back!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Writing some epic code.
